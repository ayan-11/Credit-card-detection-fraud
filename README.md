# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for building a credit card fraud detection system using a logistic regression model. Credit card fraud is a significant concern in financial transactions, and machine learning techniques can help identify fraudulent transactions, thus protecting both consumers and financial institutions.

In this repository, you'll find a Python-based implementation of a logistic regression model to detect credit card fraud from a labeled dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.7 or later)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running the provided notebooks)
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayan-11/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

2. Download the credit card transaction dataset. You can obtain this dataset from a reliable source, or use publicly available datasets like the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

3. Prepare the data. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and labeled. Data preprocessing steps such as normalization, feature engineering, and handling missing values may be necessary.

4. Train the Logistic Regression model. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`train_logistic_regression.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a logistic regression model for credit card fraud detection. Customize the notebook according to your dataset and requirements.

5. Evaluate the model. After training, you should evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

6. Fine-tune the model (if necessary). You can experiment with different hyperparameters, feature selection, or other techniques to improve model performance.

7. Make predictions. Use the trained logistic regression model to predict fraudulent transactions in real-time or on new datasets.
